## Andrew Clarke

I am a highly capable and competent professional with a proven track record of delivering accurate, high quality technical analysis (engineering & financial). My main strength lies in working in colloborative environments where I communicate effectively and interface with multi-discipline teams to provide integrated solutions for complex projects. 

A life-long passion for learning, turning ideas into systems / structures and bringing order to chaos has led me to my latest adventure at Makers Acdemy; a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp. After completing Makers, my intention is to find a role as a Junior Developer and further enhance my skills by working with and learning from others who are passionate about clean code, TDD, OOP and agile development. Ideally, I want to work for an organisation focussed on developing great software that makes peoples' lives more enjoyable and easier to manage.

## Interests

I am a keen investor and enjoy reading about wealth management, financial products and maro-economic news. International travel is a passion of mine, especially to areas of natural beauty and UNESCO world heritage sites. I love roaming around the Scottish countryside with my stout little beagle (Oscar) and try and bag a munro when I can. I have recently completed my PADI Open Water and would love to gain more advanced qualifications in scuba diving.
