## Andrew Clarke

I'm a highly capable and competent professional with a proven track record of delivering accurate, high quality technical analysis (engineering & financial) and supporting documentation. My main strength lies in working in colloborative environments where I communicate effectively and interface with multi-discipline teams to provide integrated solutions for complex projects. I love to bring order to chaos and have a passion for turning ideas into logical systems and structures. 

A life-long passion for learning and converting ideas into tangibles has led me on my latest adventure at Makers Acdemy - a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp. After completing Makers, my intention is to find a role as a Junior Developer and further enhance my skills by working with and learning from others who are passionate about clean code, TDD, OOP and agile development. 

## Skills

#### Teamwork & Communication

BP: worked as the main Drilling Engineer/Project Manager for the abandonment of an old well (Magnus D4) with integrity issues, which required the engagement of a multi-discipline team (Subsea Engineering, Well Interventions, Subsurface Geology, Drilling etc.) to devise solutions for complex engineering challenges. Confident at communicating engineering and financial issues with colleagues of varying seniorities via a variety of mediums (technical file notes, SoR's, powerpoint presentations, engineering analysis documents) 

JP Morgan: interfaced with local (UK/London-based) and international teams (US, India, Japan) to investigate and resolve financial breaks between different (Accounting, Settlements, Payments, Corporate Actions etc.) teams whilst working as part of the Accounting & Control team. 


#### Project & Risk Management

BP: experienced in identifying, analysing and mitigating against financial/operational and HSE risks as part of the Magnus D4 well abandonment. Proven ability to deliver agreed work-scopes within tight timeframes by ensuring that projects (Magnus D4 structure removal & well abandonment) progress through stage gates at agreed times. Ensured appropriate management-of-change was communicated and understood during planning and execution of D4 structure removal.
