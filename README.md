## Andrew Clarke

I'm a highly capable and competent professional with a proven track record of delivering accurate, high quality technical analysis (engineering & financial) and supporting documentation. My main strength lies in working in colloborative environments where I communicate effectively and interface with multi-discipline teams to provide integrated solutions for complex projects. I love to bring order to chaos and have a passion for turning ideas into logical systems and structures. 

A life-long passion for learning and converting ideas into tangibles has led me on my latest adventure at Makers Acdemy - a 12 week intensive coding bootcamp. After completing Makers, my intention is to find a role as a Junior Developer and further enhance my skills by working with and learning from others who are passionate about clean code, TDD, OOP and agile development.
